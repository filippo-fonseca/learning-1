### Definition List

__Abiotic Factor:__ A factor that isn't living. _For example, rain._

__Biotic factors:__ All the living organisms inhabiting the Earth.

__Organism:__ An unicellular or multicellular form of exhibiting all of the characteristics of life, an individual. For example, whit tail dear.

__Population:__ A group of one species living in the same place at the same time that interbreed.

__Community:__ Several interacting populations that inhabit a common environment and are independent.

__Ecosystem:__ Populations in a community and the abiotic factors with which they interact. _For example: marine or terrestrial_

__Biosphere:__ Life supporting portions of Earth.

__Biome:__ A biome is a large community of vegetation and wildlife adapted to a specific climate. _For example, aquatic, grassland, forest, desert, and tundra._
___

## Introduction

Within Biology, there are __many areas of study__. Here is a list of many:

-   Evolution
-   Microbiology
-   Zoology
-   Genetics
-   Biotechnology
-   Anatomy
-   Medicine
-   Ecology

In these lectures, __we will be studying Ecology.__

Ecology is defined as the science of __relationships and interactions between organisms and their environments.__

It has a focus in the transfer of energy. It also talks about the adaptations that animals have.

For example:

    In the forests of Costa Rica, the Pit Viper snakes have adapted a green pattern in their skin (camouflage) to be able to ambush their pray and catch them off guard.

Here's another example:

    Also in the jungles of Costa Rica, Yellow Belly snakes take advantage of the the Red Frog's adaptation for laying its eggs underneath tree leaves to feast on them at night.

There are many types of adaptation like:

-   Biological
-   Behavioral
-   Physical

___

## Levels of Biological Organization

Every organism has many levels of organization; from atoms to the biosphere

For example:

-   Earth
-   Rain Forest
-   Red Tree frogs, Yellow Belly Snakes.
-   Red Tree Frogs
-   Red Tre Frog

___

## Biomes 

A biome represents its ecosystems.

Within all biomes, there are sub-bioms

__Ex:__ Aquatic - Fresh Water - Salt Water

Within a biome, there are habitats and niches

__Habitats are where the organizms live.__
-   Physical Place
-   Reflects the living place of an organizm.

__A nishe is what role that the organizm plays in its environment.__
-   Fuction or Activity
-   Reflects its biotic and abiotic association with the environment.

### __This is how both relate:__

_The habitat directly and indirectly affects the niche._

This is called a __feedback loop.__ _All interconnected._

__NOTE:__ They are both specific to a particular organism.

The niche is determined by the limiting factor.

The limiting factor is any __biotic or abiotic__ factors that __resist the existance of organisms in a specific environment.__

### __Examples of limiting factors:__

-   Amount of water
-   Amount of food
-   Temperature
-   Amount of space
-   Availability of mates

___

## Types of Adaptations

There are many adaptations. You can break up these adaptations into types:

1.  Structural/Physical
2.  Behavioral
    1.  These are innate behaviors that animals are born with.
3.  Physiological
    1.  These are things that animals do that the animal doesn't choose to do.

### __Here is the example of a Snail:__

<img src="https://resize.hswstatic.com/w_1024/gif/snail-shell.jpg">

__Structural:__
-   Shell (_protection_)
-   Eye stalks (_better vision_)
-   Muscular foot (_allows it to move_)

__Behavioral:__
-   Retract into shell (_protection_)
-   Courtship to attract mates (_better reproduction_)
-   Hibernation (_survival_)

__Physiological:__
-   Producing mucus
-   Can produce sex cells from both genders

### __There are scientific names for these are:__

Structural: _Anatomical_

Behavioral: _Ethological_

Physiological: _Physiological_

### Quick Tip:

Hibernation is in the cold.
Estivation is in teh heat.

___

## Abiotic Factors

Abiotic means non living:
-   Water
-   Light
-   Wind
-   Temperature
-   pH Levels
-   Salinity
-   Nutrients

Organisms find a way to use and exploit these abiotic factors for survival.

Many organisms need these abiotic factors to survive. __These are called abiotic factors that promote survival__. Others mak it harder for an organisms survive. __These are called limiting factors.__

Adaptations are changes that organisms evolve to have to be able to cope and survive with their abiotic factors.

___

## Relationships between Organisms

When two organisms has a relation ship, they fall into one of five groups.

#### **They are called:**

1.  Parasitism
2.  Mutualism
3.  Commensalism
4.  Predation
5.  Competition

**Parasitism** is when one organism is harmed and the other is benefited.

**Commensalism** is when one organism benefits and it is neutral for the other one.

**Mutualism** when both organisms benefit.

**Predation** is when one organism eats.

**Competition** is when two or more organisms fight for resources.

___

## Biodiversity

Biodiversity is the variety of life in the world or in a particular habitat or ecosystem.

There are three types of biodiversity:

1.  Ecosystem diversity
2.  Species diversity
3.  Genetic diversity

### **Ecosystem Diversity**

The ecosystem diversity is the smallest type of diversity. This is all about the different species in biomes.

**EX:** Rain Forest | _Spider Monkey, Tapir, Jaguar, etc_

### **Species Diversity**

The species diversity is the second largest type of diversity. This is all about the different species in an animals in the species. 

**EX:** Monkey | _Howler Monkey, Spider Monkey, White Face Monkey, etc._

### **Genetic Diversity**

The Genetic diversity is the largest type of diversity. This is all about the differences in genetics in a species.

**EX:** Human | _Asians, Latin Americans, Africans_

**The rule of biodiversity:** The more diversity, the less competition there is for resources.

### **How to tell if two animals are in a species?**

If the animals don't reproduce together, they aren't the same species.

However, they all come from the the same ancestor.

### **Benefits of Biodiversity**

### **Importance of Biodiversity**

-   Increases Money  For Humans
    -   Greater genetic diversity withing a crop species = bigger crop yield.
    -   More spices of fish = More choices and more sales.
- 

___

## Calculating Biodiversity

When you're calculating biodiversity, you use something called GRNMS.

Scientists will use a sampling technique. They will put a box down and count the biodiversity within the box. This will give them the idea of what's the biodiversity of a certain region.

### **Follow these steps to follow the biodiversity**

1.  Identify all of the species in the area you're researching.
2.  Count how many of each of each of the species there are.
3.  Take the total number of species found and divide by total number of individuals found in the entire quadrat.
