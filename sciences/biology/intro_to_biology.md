### Definition List

__Abiotic Factor:__ A factor that isn't living. _For example, rain._

__Biotic factors:__ All the living organisms inhabiting the Earth.

__Organism:__ An unicellular or multicellular form of exhibiting all of the characteristics of life, an individual. For example, whit tail dear.

__Population:__ A group of one species living in the same place at the same time that interbreed.

__Community:__ Several interacting populations that inhabit a common environment and are independent.

__Ecosystem:__ Populations in a community and the abiotic factors with which they interact. _For example: marine or terrestrial_

__Biosphere:__ Life supporting portions of Earth.

__Biome:__ A biome is a large community of vegetation and wildlife adapted to a specific climate. _For example, aquatic, grassland, forest, desert, and tundra._

## Introduction

Within Biology, there are __many areas of study__. Here is a list of many:

-   Evolution
-   Microbiology
-   Zoology
-   Genetics
-   Biotechnology
-   Anatomy
-   Medicine
-   Ecology

In these lectures, __we will be studying Ecology.__

Ecology is defined as the science of __relationships and interactions between organisms and their environments.__

It has a focus in the transfer of energy. It also talks about the adaptations that animals have.

For example:

    In the forests of Costa Rica, the Pit Viper snakes have adapted a green pattern in their skin (camouflage) to be able to ambush their pray and catch them off guard.

Here's another example:

    Also in the jungles of Costa Rica, Yellow Belly snakes take advantage of the the Red Frog's adaptation for laying its eggs underneath tree leaves to feast on them at night.

There are many types of adaptation like:

-   Biological
-   Behavioral
-   Physical

___

## Levels of Biological Organization

Every organism has many levels of organization; from atoms to the biosphere

For example:

-   Earth
-   Rain Forest
-   Red Tree frogs, Yellow Belly Snakes.
-   Red Tree Frogs
-   Red Tre Frog

___

## Biomes 

A biome represents its ecosystems.

Within all biomes, there are sub-biome

__Ex:__ Aquatic - Fresh Water - Salt Water

Within a biome, there are habitats and niches

__Habitats are where the organisms live.__
-   Physical Place
-   Reflects the living place of an organism.

__A niche is what role that the organism plays in its environment.__
-   Function or Activity
-   Reflects its biotic and abiotic association with the environment.

### __This is how both relate:__

_The habitat directly and indirectly affects the niche._

This is called a __feedback loop.__ _All interconnected._

__NOTE:__ They are both specific to a particular organism.

The niche is determined by the limiting factor.

The limiting factor is any __biotic or abiotic__ factors that __resist the existence of organisms in a specific environment.__

### __Examples of limiting factors:__

-   Amount of water
-   Amount of food
-   Temperature
-   Amount of space
-   Availability of mates

___

## Types of Adaptations

There are many adaptations. You can break up these adaptations into types:

1.  Structural/Physical
2.  Behavioral
    1.  These are innate behaviors that animals are born with.
3.  Physiological
    1.  These are things that animals do that the animal doesn't choose to do.

### __Here is the example of a Snail:__

<img src="https://resize.hswstatic.com/w_1024/gif/snail-shell.jpg">

__Structural:__
-   Shell (_protection_)
-   Eye stalks (_better vision_)
-   Muscular foot (_allows it to move_)

__Behavioral:__
-   Retract into shell (_protection_)
-   Courtship to attract mates (_better reproduction_)
-   Hibernation (_survival_)

__Physiological:__
-   Producing mucus
-   Can produce sex cells from both genders

### __There are scientific names for these are:__

Structural: _Anatomical_

Behavioral: _Ethological_

Physiological: _Physiological_

### Quick Tip:

Hibernation is in the cold.
Estivation is in teh heat.

___

## Abiotic Factors

Abiotic means non living:
-   Water
-   Light
-   Wind
-   Temperature
-   pH Levels
-   Salinity
-   Nutrients

Organisms find a way to use and exploit these abiotic factors for survival.

Many organisms need these abiotic factors to survive. __These are called abiotic factors that promote survival__. Others mak it harder for an organisms survive. __These are called limiting factors.__

Adaptations are changes that organisms evolve to have to be able to cope and survive with their abiotic factors.
