__Abiotic Factor:__ A factor that isn't living. _For example, rain._

__Biotic factors:__ All the living organisms inhabiting the Earth.

__Organism:__ An unicellular or multicellular form of exhibiting all of the characteristics of life, an individual. For example, whit tail dear.

__Population:__ A group of one species living in the same place at the same time that interbreed.

__Community:__ Several interacting populations that inhabit a common environment and are independent.

__Ecosystem:__ Populations in a community and the abiotic factors with which they interact. _For example: marine or terrestrial_

__Biosphere:__ Life supporting portions of Earth.

__Biome:__ A biome is a large community of vegetation and wildlife adapted to a specific climate. _For example, aquatic, grassland, forest, desert, and tundra._

## Introduction

Within Biology, there are __many areas of study__. Here is a list of many:

-   Evolution
-   Microbiology
-   Zoology
-   Genetics
-   Biotechnology
-   Anatomy
-   Medicine
-   Ecology

In these lectures, __we will be studying Ecology.__

Ecology is defined as the science of __relationships and interactions between organisms and their environments.__

It has a focus in the transfer of energy. It also talks about the adaptations that animals have.

For example:

    In the forests of Costa Rica, the Pit Viper snakes have adapted a green pattern in their skin (camouflage) to be able to ambush their pray and catch them off guard.

Here's another example:

    Also in the jungles of Costa Rica, Yellow Belly snakes take advantage of the the Red Frog's adaptation for laying its eggs underneath tree leaves to feast on them at night.

There are many types of adaptation like:

-   Biological
-   Behavioral
-   Physical

___

## Levels of Biological Organization

Every organism has many levels of organization; from atoms to the biosphere

For example:

-   Earth
-   Rain Forest
-   Red Tree frogs, Yellow Belly Snakes.
-   Red Tree Frogs
-   Red Tre Frog
