# ðŸ“¢ Histograms

## Intro

Histograms and Bar charts are very similar but there are some differences:

__In Bar Charts:__
1.  Bar charts only represent qualitative data. 
2.  Spaces between bars
3.  Height represents frequency

__In Histogram:__
1.  Histogram only represent qualitative, discrete and continuous data. 
2.  The bars don't have to be equal width (_width depends on intervals_)
3.  No spaces between bars
4.  The area of the bars represents the frequency, not the height.
5.  Frequency, relative frequency or frequency density are in y axis.

## Making Histograms

To create a histogram, follow these steps:

1.  Consider X and Y axis (_y is always frequency, x is the data_)
2.  Remember to include the units
3.  Then consider the scale. Y axis always start at 0 and ends in max frequency.
4.  Add the little squiggly thing. 
5.  Go from the lowest value in the intervals to the highest value in the intervals in X axis.
6.  Plot the intervals.
7.  The bars are always the span of what the intervals are.
