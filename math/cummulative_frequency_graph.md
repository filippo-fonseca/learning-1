# ðŸ›¢ Cumulative Frequency Tables & Graphs

__What does it tell you:__ How much of your data is between a certain range.

### __Plotting Cumulative Frequency Tables__

1.  First, look at the data and tell if the data is __contunuous__ or __descrete__. If the data is continuous [follow these steps](). If your data is descrete [follow these steps]().


### __Creating a  Cumulative Frequency Tables__

__With Continuous Data:__
1.  Get your Interval Width (_ex: 0 < x â‰¤ 4_)
2.  Create the Table:
    1.  Have a column for interval widths.
    2.  When creating the intervals, the the intervals can overlap: (_ex 0 < x â‰¤ 4 | 4 < x â‰¤ 8_) __See how the 4 overlaps.__
    3.  Find all of the frequency for the intervals and plot them. (_ex: 0 < x â‰¤ 4 | 5_)
    4.  Get cumulative frequency just by adding by the new frequency and plot it. (_ex: 0 < x â‰¤ 4 | 5 | 5_)
    5.  Here is how a table would look like:

| Class Intervals | Frequency | Cumulative Frequency |
| --------------- | --------- | -------------------- |
| 0 < x â‰¤ 10 | 1 | 1 |
| 10 < x â‰¤ 20 | 3 | 4 |
| 20 < x â‰¤ 30 | 8 | 12 |
| 30 < x â‰¤ 40 | 5 | 17 |
| 40 < x â‰¤ 50 | 2 | 19 |

__With Descrete Data:__
1.  Get your Interval Width (_ex: 0 < x â‰¤ 4_)
2.  Create the Table:
    1.  Have a column for interval widths.
    2.  When creating the intervals, the the intervals can overlap: (_ex 0 < x â‰¤ 4 | 4 < x â‰¤ 8_) __See how the 4 overlaps.__
    3.  Find all of the frequency for the intervals and plot them. (_ex: 0 < x â‰¤ 4 | 5_)
    4.  Get cumulative frequency just by adding by the new frequency and plot it. (_ex: 0 < x â‰¤ 4 | 5 | 5_)
    5.  Here is how a table would look like:

| Class Intervals | Frequency | Cumulative Frequency |
| --------------- | --------- | -------------------- |
| 0 â‰¤ x â‰¤ 10 | 1 | 1 |
| 11 â‰¤ x â‰¤ 20 | 3 | 4 |
| 20 â‰¤ x â‰¤ 30 | 8 | 12 |
| 30 â‰¤ x â‰¤ 40 | 5 | 17 |
| 40 â‰¤ x â‰¤ 50 | 2 | 19 |
