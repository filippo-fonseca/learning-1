# ðŸ›¢ Cumulative Frequency Tables & Graphs

__What does it tell you:__ How much of your data is between a certain range.

### __Creating a  Cumulative Frequency Tables__

__With Continuous Data:__
1.  Get your Interval Width (_ex: 0 < x â‰¤ 4_)
    1.  __Remember, you want 8 - 15 intervals.__
2.  Create the Table:
    1.  Have a column for interval widths.
    2.  When creating the intervals, the the intervals can overlap: (_ex 0 < x â‰¤ 4 | 4 < x â‰¤ 8_) __See how the 4 overlaps.__
    3.  Find all of the frequency for the intervals and plot them. (_ex: 0 < x â‰¤ 4 | 5_)
    4.  Get cumulative frequency just by adding by the new frequency and plot it. (_ex: 0 < x â‰¤ 4 | 5 | 5_)
    5.  Here is how a table would look like:

| Class Intervals | Frequency | Cumulative Frequency |
| --------------- | --------- | -------------------- |
| 0 < x â‰¤ 10 | 1 | 1 |
| 10 < x â‰¤ 20 | 3 | 4 |
| 20 < x â‰¤ 30 | 8 | 12 |
| 30 < x â‰¤ 40 | 5 | 17 |
| 40 < x â‰¤ 50 | 2 | 19 |

__With Discrete Data:__
1.  Get your Interval Width (_ex: 0 < x â‰¤ 4_)
    1.  __Remember, you want 8 - 15 intervals.__
2.  Create the Table:
    1.  Have a column for interval widths.
    2.  When creating the intervals, the the intervals can overlap: (_ex 0 â‰¤ x â‰¤ 4 | 5 â‰¤ x â‰¤ 9_) __See how the 4 doesn't overlaps.__
    3.  Find all of the frequency for the intervals and plot them. (_ex: 0 â‰¤ x â‰¤ 4 | 5_)
    4.  Get cumulative frequency just by adding by the new frequency and plot it. (_ex: 0 < x â‰¤ 4 | 5 | 5_)
    5.  Here is how a table would look like:

| Class Intervals | Frequency | Cumulative Frequency |
| --------------- | --------- | -------------------- |
| 0 â‰¤ x â‰¤ 10 | 1 | 1 |
| 11 â‰¤ x â‰¤ 21 | 3 | 4 |
| 22 â‰¤ x â‰¤ 32 | 8 | 12 |
| 33 â‰¤ x â‰¤ 43 | 5 | 17 |
| 44 â‰¤ x â‰¤ 54 | 2 | 19 |
</br>

__Adding Upper Boundary:__

1.  Next, we must add the new upper boundary of your class intervals

| Class Intervals | Frequency | Cumulative Frequency | Upper Boundary |
| --------------- | --------- | -------------------- | -------------- |
| 0 â‰¤ x â‰¤ 10 | 1 | 1 | 10.5 |
| 11 â‰¤ x â‰¤ 21 | 3 | 4 | 21.5 |
| 22 â‰¤ x â‰¤ 32 | 8 | 12 | 32.5 |
| 33 â‰¤ x â‰¤ 43 | 5 | 17 | 43.5 |
| 44 â‰¤ x â‰¤ 54 | 2 | 19 | 54.5 |

1.  If there isn't another upper boundary between the last class interval, just add the highest interval by 0.5.
2.  If your data is continuous, then your upper boundary is just top of each class interval

| Class Intervals | Frequency | Cumulative Frequency | Upper Boundary |
| --------------- | --------- | -------------------- | -------------- |
| 0 < x â‰¤ 10 | 1 | 1 | 10 |
| 10 < x â‰¤ 20 | 3 | 4 | 20 |
| 20 < x â‰¤ 30 | 8 | 12 | 30 |
| 30 < x â‰¤ 40 | 5 | 17 | 40 |
| 40 < x â‰¤ 50 | 2 | 19 | 50 |

### __Plotting the Data in a Graph__

1.  __Draw the graph:__
    1.  Make the Y axis go up to the highest number in your cumulative frequency.
    2.  Make the X axis go up to the highest number in your upper boundary
    3.  Name the Y axis _"Cumulative Frequency"_ and the X axis _"# of whatever your measuring"_
2. __Plot the data:__
   1. Remember, for your X axis, your plotting your cumulative frequency.
   2. For your Y axis, your plotting the new upper boundary that you just got.
   3. Now, connect the dots with straight lines.

### __Turning Graph to a Box and Whisker Plot__

1.  The first thing to note with a box and whisker is
