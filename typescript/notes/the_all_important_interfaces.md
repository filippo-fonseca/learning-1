# ðŸ¥‘ The All Important Interfaces

## Interfaces

Interfaces are **basically type annotations on steroids.** These will truly permit us to use TS at it's fullest. They are **what makes TS so powerful.**

With classes, interfaces will allow us to reuse code in ways never before.

Interfaces just **create a new type, describing the property names and value types of an object.**

## Long Type Annotations

The problem with type annotations of objects is that they are **really long**.

```ts
const markProperties = {
  name: 'Mark',
  lastName: 'Music',
  age: 15,
};

const printDetails = (mark: {
  name: string;
  lastName: string;
  age: number;
}) => {
  console.log(`Name : ${mark.name} ${mark.lastName}`);
  console.log(`Age : ${mark.age}`);
};
```

As you can see, the type annotations seem endless. This is even worse when you need to write this type annotation multiple times. However, here is where **interfaces** come in handy.

---

## Fixing Long Type Annotations

To fix this, we can simply use an **interface**.

```ts
interface Person {
  name: string;
  lastName: string;
  age: number;
}

const markProperties = {
  name: 'Mark',
  lastName: 'Music',
  age: 15,
};

const printDetails = (mark: Person) => {
  console.log(`Name : ${mark.name} ${mark.lastName}`);
  console.log(`Age : ${mark.age}`);
};
```

**CODE DECONSTRUCTION:** In this code snippet, we are simply replacing that long annotation with an interface called `Person`. _Notice how it's capitalized and generic._ To create an interface, follow these steps:

1.  `interface` tells TS that you are declaring an interface.
2.  `Person` is just the name of the type you're creating.
3.  `{}` is what the type consists of.
4.  `name: string` is simply telling TS that the `Person` type has a property called `name` and it's value is of type string.
5.  `lastName: string` and `age: number` are basically the same.

_Notice how the property names are the same, as much as their value types._

## Syntax Around Interfaces

We are **not limited to set primitive types** in an interface. You can set any type. **Even other types created by other interfaces.**

```ts
interface Person {
  name: string;
  lastName: string;
  age: Date;
  summary(): string;
}

const markProperties = {
  name: 'Mark',
  lastName: 'Music',
  age: new Date(),
  summary() {
    return `Name: ${this.name} ${this.lastName}
Age: ${this.age}`;
  },
};

const printDetails = (mark: Person) => {
  console.log(mark.summary());
};
```

**CODE DECONSTRUCTION:** In this code snippet, we are using more complex types in the interface.

1.  The `age` property has a type of `Date`
2.  The `summary` property has a type of `summary():string;`

Note how **we use the ES15 syntax** to **use functions in an object**. We can **do the same for interfaces.**
