# ⚙️ Mastering Typed Arrays

## Arrays in TypeScript

Arrays in TS are **basically the same** as in JS. We can stil `push` and `pop` etc. _The only difference is that in TS, **we will mostly only use indexes of the same type** in the array._

**EXAMPLE:** If we create an array of strings, we will only put indexes with types of string in the array.

You could put indexes with different types but you **have** to be very specific on what are the types by using _Type Annotation_.
