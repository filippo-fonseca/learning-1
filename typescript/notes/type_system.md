# ⌨️ Type System

__What is a type system:__ A type system is an easy way to refer to the different `properties` and `functions` that a value has.

__For example:__ 
```ts
let a = "red";
```
The value `"red"` has a type of string. You can go more in depth and say: "`red` is a value hat has properties and methods that we asume that a string has".

**_Type is basically a shortcut to describe the different properties and methods that a single value has._**

__REMEMBER:__ Every value in TS has a type.

## Examples of Types

__Common types:__
* string - `"example"`
* number - `14`
* boolean - `false`
* object - `{id: 1, completed: false, title: "Todo 1"}`
